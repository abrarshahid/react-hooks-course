# React Hooks Course
This project was bootstrapped with Create-React-App.

I got clear concept about React hooks in these examples.
The Hooks are:
i) useState
ii) UseEffect
iii) useRef
iv) useMemo
v) useReducer
vi) useContext
vii) useCallback
viii) useFetch(custom)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
